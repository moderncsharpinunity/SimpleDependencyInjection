# Simple Dependency Injection

This is a simple dependency injection framework for Unity3D, started as part of a blog to explain how to build your own dependency injection in Unity3D, but now will be evolved and maintained as an independent software.
There are two blog entries covering the initial state for this DI framework, and more might be written in the future as development continues.
